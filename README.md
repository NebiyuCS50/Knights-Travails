# Knights-Travails

This project finds the shortest path for a knight to travel from one position to another on a standard 8x8 chessboard.

## Usage

The main function is `knightMoves(start, end)` in [script.js](script.js).

- `start`: Array of two numbers `[x, y]` representing the starting position.
- `end`: Array of two numbers `[x, y]` representing the target position.

Example:

```js
console.log(knightMoves([3, 3], [4, 3]));
```
